# GraphQL

implemented a database connection with the form created before and applying GraphQl onto that for making crud opertions onto that and it will also do changes into the grid component which performed earlier with the database connection and it will also do changes into the grid component into the admin panel which i have implemented in the admin panel of the magento.

so, qwe can see the changes by performing crud opertaions using GraphQl in maggento admin panel in table of the users, database and into the postman.

by using post man we have implemented this GraphQl for seeing our changes which we have created and do perform the whole crud operations onto the postman.

Also, we can perform GraphQl using the GraphQl extension which is bydefault we can set into the our system.
